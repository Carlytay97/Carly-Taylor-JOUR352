  <h2>Experience</h2>
  <h3>Intern</h3>
  <h4>Time4Coffee</h4>
  <h5>2019-present</h5>
  I spearheaded the company’s first Facebook strategy. I create and plan social media content for platforms including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. I edit audio for podcast episodes and write about the businesspeople featured on selected episodes.

  <h3>Publications Intern</h3>
  <h4>University of Maryland Office of Strategic Communications</h4>
  <h5>2018-present</h5>
  I coordinate and write news stories for Maryland Today and Terp, which are publications that the office produces. I regularly exercise research, writing and reporting skills. Additionally, I edit and proofread copy for the office’s marketing materials, including advertisements placed in publications.

  <h3>Production Intern</h3>
  <h4>ABC’s ‘The View’</h4>
  <h5>2018</h5>
  I learned a lot about television production through shadowing and assisting in the control room, studio floor and edit bay. I helped maintain the well-being of the show’s talent and guests by being hospitable. I worked closely with digital coordinators to verify images, video and music used for the show.

  <h3>College Associate</h3>
  <h4>Fox News</h4>
  <h5>2017</h5>
  I wrote scripts for Fox News Edge, which produces news for local, affiliate stations across the country. I edited video packages and interviews. I communicated with stations to learn about local news stories that may be of interest to a wider audience.

  <h3>Staff Writer</h3>
  <h4>The Diamondback</h4>
  <h5>2016-2017</h5>
  I pitched three story ideas and wrote at least two articles every week for the student government beat. I attended and covered student government meetings and communicated with government leaders and their constituents regularly. I repurposed stories for social use, specifically on the newspaper’s Snapchat Discover page.
