  Carly Taylor is graduating in May from the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland.
   She has aspirations to work in digital media post-graduation. Her internship experience ranges from
   broadcast television to online editorial content. In her spare time, Carly enjoys scrolling social media
   over scrambled eggs and a coffee, tapping it back on the bike and watching re-runs of The Office.
   She’s done some cool stuff, which you can check out under “My Work,” and she’s open to any new opportunities
   that come her way!
