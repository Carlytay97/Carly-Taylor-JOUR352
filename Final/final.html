  <p class="subhead">From the 21st century into the future</p>
  <p class="byline">By Carly Taylor</p>

  <p> Over the past two decades, the way we consume media has evolved at rapid speeds.</p>

  <p>Newspapers and magazines have launched websites, television can now be watched
exclusively on our laptops and even cell phones, social media – from Myspace to Instagram
– has provided new channels for interpersonal connection. And now, information
that was once limited to an at-home or motor vehicle stereo is available at our finger tips.</p>

  <p>On a walk to class, during morning and evening commutes, while vegging on the couch
– 33 percent of Americans are plugging in their headphones (or connecting to Bluetooth)
at least once a month to tune into their favorite audio stories, according to Statista.</p>

  <p>Whether you’re looking to rattle your mind with a true crime show, to delve in
deeper to today’s top headline, or to chuckle at the banter between your favorite celebrities,
there’s a podcast for everyone. There’s more than 700,000 shows, according to Podcast Insights,
on a digital shelf near you.</p>

<p>But how did we get here?</p>


<p class="chapter"><a name="First Headline"></a>Where it all began</p>
<p>The Internet is eager to pinpoint “Serial” – the highly acclaimed investigative series
  hosted by journalist Sarah Koenig – as the birth of the podcast craze.</p>

<p>Whether this was the catalyst that brought podcasts into the forefront of popular culture
  can be debated, but the history of the medium can be traced back a full decade before the
  first episode premiered in 2014.</p>

<p>Chris Lydon and Susie Bright are just a couple of the names known for their audio content,
  which was downloadable from their blogs circa 2004, The Guardian reports.</p>

<p>At the time, creators exploring new technologies and the journalists who covered them still
  weren’t sure what to label this new intersection of audio software, portable media players and blogging.</p>

<p>“But what to call it? Audioblogging? Podcasting? GuerillaMedia?” The Guardian’s Ben Hammersley wrote.<p>

<p>The term in the middle just stuck.</p>

<p>As more individuals and media companies debuted new podcasts, technology-focused companies,
  including Apple, Yahoo, Google, worked to make consumption more accessible for listeners.
  International Podcast Day highlights iTunes new podcast feature in 2005 and Google’s acquisition
  of podcast service, Feedburner, in 2007. </p>

<p>However, it wasn’t until 2014 that Apple added a podcast app to the iPhone,
  that the technology truly transformed, according to The New Yorker.</p>

<p>Podcasts were getting good (Serial had reached a million listeners in its first month,
  The New Yorker reported), and the process to subscribe and listen was a whole lot easier
  (at least if you were an iPhone user).</p>

  <p>The fast-moving, short attention-spanned citizens
  of the digital age responded.</p>

<p class="chapter"><a name="Second Headline"></a>What makes a podcast successful?</p>
<p>While podcasting isn’t an exact science, there are a few best practices that
  audio creators should hone in on if they want any chance of making it to the big
  leagues – or at least the “top 100 chart” on iTunes.</p>

<p>An interesting subject is one of the most important components of a podcast,
  said Robert Little, investigative reporter and editor for NPR.</p>

<p>“If you don’t have that, that’s probably well over half of what is going to work,” Little said.</p>


<p>Having a host who can connect an audience with a story and incorporating action,
  like bringing in another perspective or tone of voice, should also be considered
  in making a podcast, Little said. </p>

<p>Radio host and podcast consultant Lauren Ober cautions that there is no
  “special sauce” to get seen among the hundreds of thousands of shows on the market.</p>

<p>While a good narrative podcast should focus on aspects like reporting and audio,
  an interview show should emphasize engaging guests and good questions, Ober tells Time4Coffee podcast.</p>

<!-- END second graphic container-->
<div id="container" class="second-block">
<p>However, there are a few definitive mistakes podcasters should look to avoid.
  Those who don’t consider the audience during the production process are typically less successful, Ober said.</p>

<p>“You can make a podcast is slapdash as you want, but putting in the effort to edit it,
  putting in the effort to mix it and sound design it and have a signature sound to it is really important,”
  Ober tells Time4Coffee.</p>

<p>Little agrees, calling the use of bad audio in a podcast a “rookie mistake.”</p>

<p>“It’s going to make it very difficult for somebody to listen to,
  even if what the people are saying is interesting,” Little said.</p>

<p>Podcasters who lack direction in their storytelling is critical, too, Ober said.</p>

<p>“What do you want to tell?...Does your voice need to be on it? Do you even need to have a show?
  I think these are questions that people could ask themselves,” Ober tells Time4Coffee.</p>

<div id="container" class="second-block">
<p class="chapter"><a name="Third Headline"></a>What does the future hold?</p>
<p>While the days of dial-up and iPods during which this platform emerged seem distant to many,
  podcasts are still regarded as a relatively new medium, Little said.</p>

<p>Listenership and number of shows continues to grow. This year marks record growth for the industry
  – consumers report an average of nearly 17 hours spent listening to online audio per week,
  according to Edison Research.</p>

  </div>
  <!-- END third graphic container-->
<div id="container" class="second-block">
<p>There are commercial opportunities, like advertising, that allow podcasts to remain a significant
  force in the market.</p>

<p>The real question, Little said, is whether podcast is the future of radio.
  Listeners have already changed music-consumption habits, downloading mobile apps
  like Spotify or Pandora instead of turning on the radio.</p>
